	Built on land acquired in 1799 by John Jacob Astor, America's first millionaire, 875 Washington Street was commissioned in 1887 by Astor's grandson William Backhouse Astor Jr.  By that time the district had become the Gansevoort Market, one of New York's most bustling commercial districts, and architect John W. Cole designed a suitably monumental Queen Anne market building for the double-long site, featuring cast iron storefronts, metal canopies, large windows and handsome brickwork.  Cole's work in the area included two other buildings for the Astor heirs, both still standing, but 875 Washington was the largest and grandest of the three.

	A major address of the day, 875 Washington housed numerous leading produce merchants, some of whom maintained their location here for decades. From the 1920s onwards, the primary tenants were meatpackers, whose rise to predominance in the market gave the area its current name, The Meatpacking District.

	<p>
	As shipping and storage trends changed the area went into a slow decline: 875 Washington Street lost its cornice but maintained numerous other original features. Meatpackers remained active but the district gradually became associated with cutting-edge and alternative nightlife, largely centered around New York City's GLBT communities: in the 1990s the infamous biker bar Hogs & Heifers opened in 875 Washington Street, adding to the neighborhood's established after-hours character.

	<p>
	With the coming Jeffery in 1999 the district began to transition to a fashionable location.  Galleries, design shops and couture houses lined West 14th Street and private clubs such as Soho House and the Norwood Club are overshadowed by the newly renovated High Line Park, a masterpiece of urban renewal.

	As the Whitney Museum of American Art settles into its new home a block away, 875 Washington endures as the most imposing survivor of the old Gansevoort Market days, its cornice restored, its cast iron and canopies intact and its preeminence in the district assured for the next chapter of New York's history.
